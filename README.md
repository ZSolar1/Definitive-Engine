# Definitive Engine

 - ## What is it? 
	  Definitive Engine is all about making modding a breeze! It's built on top of the base game, so you can easily customize it. There is currently an extremely detailed wiki that covers everything from modding the the engine externally to diving into the source code. Don't think that all of this documentation and information on how to use the engine means everything is hard to use though, because we want this engine to be as easy to mod as possible. We don't want this engine to be too cluttered, and keep a lot of the base game aspects. We want it to act like a clean slate of fnf from the surface, but once you dig deep, we want people to feel like this engine can do basically anything without too much difficulty.
   
 -  ## How deep really is the wiki? 	
	 The detailed modding wiki provides an in-depth tutorial on how to use lua and hscript in Definitive engine, and on how to modify Definitive Engine in source. It covers various aspects like customizing gameplay mechanics, creating new assets, and even implementing your own features. It also has the features of basic documentation, like explaining functions, variables, etc. in detail, as well as examples on how to use them.
	 
- ## Is modding the engine really that easy?
	Yes! The modding of this engine is very simple, yet it can get more and more complex the more you want to do. adding weeks include a simple 3 line xml file, adding songs doesn't need separate folders(data folder for chart and songs folder for music) not because there is only a songs folder. You can drag a packaged mod(.dem files(stands for definitive engine mod)) into the "mods/packagedMods" folder and they will automatically load in the game, and you can package mods by using the mod packager in the editors menu. The characters folder contain the characters json, xml, and images in one folder. Your song will have a assets folder in the song for assets specifically for the song. This is just scratching the surface by the way. you can also use hscript and lua in your song to do all kinds of things! you can make menus, replace menus, etc. if you want to dig deeper though. A lot of information, tutorials, and documentation is on the wiki page so if your curious, check that out.
